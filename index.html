            <p ><a class= "maintalk">So far, the COVID-19 pandemic has taken the lives of 400,000 people and hospitalizations have reached 2 million. With these numbers rising by the day, both for aduls and children, it is
                now more important than ever that we behave safetely and appropriately. Unfortunately, the information on the pademic is scattered, and often blurred by society. This is why we decided to put together a page
                that aims to clarify misconceptions, act as a guide to acting safety, and update all of you on current events. We hope you find this platform useful!
