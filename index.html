            <p ><a class= "maintalk">so far the covid-19 pandemic has taken the lives of 2 million people and the number of cases has reached 96 million worldwide. with these numbers rising by the day, both for adults and children, it is
                now more important than ever that we behave safely and appropriately. unfortunately, the information on the pandemic is scattered, and often blurred by society. this is why we decided to put together a page
                that aims to clarify misconceptions, act as a guide to acting safety, and update all of you on current events. we hope you find this platform useful!

            <p><a class= "maintalk">currently, it's so hard to find information that has no bs claims, and is entertaining. we want to make that easier by giving you a resource for full-on facts (so hard to come by these days).
                yes, medical websites are helpful, but they're hard to read. this has all the latest info and facts (with real math!) in an easy and fun to read way! we hope ya like this.</a> </p>
