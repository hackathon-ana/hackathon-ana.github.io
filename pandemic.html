            <h2>answers to all the questions you're too scared to ask about covid-19.</h2>
            <h3><a class= "maintalk">why do i have to social distance? i'm not at-risk.</a></h3>
            <p><a class= "maintalk">there are 2 reasons to socially distance. first, to protect yourself and others from getting covid-19. you may not seem at-risk, but covid-19 has killed and hospitalized many healthy 20-year olds. also, if covid-19 has no impact on you, then you're more likely to spread it to others as you don't know you're sick. we know it feels weird to wear face masks, but better safe and helpful toward others than sorry.</a> </p>

            <h3><a class= "maintalk">when will i be able to see my friends again?</a></h3>
            <p><a class= "maintalk">vaccines are being distributed right now to more high-risk populations (think people who are immunocompromised, healthcare workers or the elderly). in the us, biden hopes to get a vaccine to people who aren't in those categories by june. however, timelines can change. for now, meet your friends with masks or host zoom pajama parties!</a> </p>
